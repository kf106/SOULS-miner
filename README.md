# SOULS Miner - Level Up Your PFP

The Social Media Portrait Token (SOULS) is an NFT contract based on a modification of the OpenZeppelin ERC721 implementation.

Each token has its own level, which can be bumped up by submitting the correct codes to the contract levelUp function.

However, finding the right code is like finding a needle in a haystack, as it's based on proof-of-work.

At the moment the code is a bit of a mess, but I'll tidy it up later and make it more user friendly.

## To use

Clone the repository into a folder, and then edit the string on line 52 of `mine.js` to contain your token soul string. Install the packages with `npm install`. Run with `npm run mine`
